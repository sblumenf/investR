\title{Market Regime Detection}
\description{
KISS PRINCIPLE: Rule-based regime detection, no machine learning.
Uses simple threshold logic on market indicators (VIX, correlation, momentum).
}
\details{
Dynamically adjusts risk parameters based on current market environment:
- Crisis: VIX > 25, high correlation → increase jump frequency, correlation
- Stressed: VIX rising or moderate spike → moderate adjustments
- Normal: Stable markets → baseline parameters

Data sources: Yahoo Finance (VIX via quantmod), calculated from price data
