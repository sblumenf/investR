\title{Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) Engine}
\description{
Implements Longstaff-Schwartz (2001) method for American option early exercise.
This is the TRUE LSM implementation (not the simple approximation).
}
\details{
Key innovation: Uses regression to estimate continuation value, learning
optimal exercise boundary directly from the simulation.
