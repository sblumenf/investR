\arguments{
\item{onStart}{A function that will be called before the app is actually run.
This is typically used for initialization or setting up environment.}

\item{options}{Named options that should be passed to the `runApp` call
(these can be any of the options listed in `?shiny::runApp`)}

\item{enableBookmarking}{Can be one of "url", "server", or "disable".}

\item{uiPattern}{A regular expression that will be applied to each GET
request to determine whether the `ui` should be used to handle the
request.}

\item{...}{arguments to pass to golem_opts.
See `?golem::get_golem_options` for more details.}

A Brochure app object ready to be run

\description{
This function launches the investR Shiny app using a Golem + Brochure
architecture for multi-page functionality.
}
\section{Golem + Brochure Integration}{

This app uses an advanced pattern combining two frameworks:

**Golem Framework** provides:
- Package structure for production-ready Shiny apps
- Resource management (CSS, JS, favicon) via `golem_add_external_resources()`
- Configuration management via `golem-config.yml`
- Development workflow and deployment tools

**Brochure Framework** provides:
- Multi-page routing with independent URLs
- Separate Shiny sessions per page (better performance)
- Native page navigation without complex routing logic

Unlike standard Golem apps that use `shinyApp(ui = app_ui, server = app_server)`,
this app uses `brochureApp()` and passes individual page objects created with
`brochure::page()`. Each page (defined in `page_*.R` files) has its own
independent UI and server function.
}

\section{Architecture}{

- `run_app()` - App launcher (this function)
- `page_home()` - Home page at "/"
- `page_aristocrats()` - Analysis page at "/aristocrats"
- `page_about()` - About page at "/about"
- `mod_*.R` - Shiny modules used within pages
- `fct_*.R` - Business logic functions
- `utils_*.R` - Utility helper functions
}
