\title{High-Yield Dividend Capture Analysis Functions}
\description{
Core business logic for analyzing high-yield dividend capture opportunities
across customizable stock universes. Strategy: buy at close before ex-dividend
date, sell at open on ex-dividend date, focusing on stocks with high yield
(adjustable threshold) and announced ex-dividend dates in next 1-2 business days.

\details{
Implementation uses efficient two-phase filtering:
- Phase 1: Lightweight screening via Yahoo quotes (price, yield, ex-div date)
- Phase 2: Heavy backtesting only on qualifying candidates

This is a universe-agnostic implementation. Universe-specific configurations
(ticker sources, defaults) are provided via separate config objects.
