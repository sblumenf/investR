\title{Shared Risk Simulation Engine}
\description{
DRY PRINCIPLE: Single source of truth for all Monte Carlo simulations.
This module consolidates simulation logic to avoid duplication across
position-level and portfolio-level risk analysis.
}
\details{
Supports:
- Multiple stochastic models (GBM, Jump-Diffusion, Heston)
- Single position or correlated multi-position simulations
- Configurable via RISK_CONFIG and presets
}
