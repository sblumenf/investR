\title{Calculate Adaptive Volatility Based on Time Horizon (Historical Only)}
\usage{
calculate_adaptive_volatility(ticker, days_to_expiry)
}
\arguments{
\item{ticker}{Stock ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL")}

\item{days_to_expiry}{Numeric days until position expires (can be NA for non-expiring)}
}
\value{
Numeric annualized volatility (e.g., 0.35 for 35%)
}
\description{
**NOTE**: For new code, use `get_volatility()` from fct_implied_volatility.R instead.
That function tries implied volatility first, then falls back to this method.
}
\details{
This function estimates annualized volatility using HISTORICAL data only:
- Short-term (≤90 days): EWMA with λ=0.94 on 60 days (reactive to recent volatility)
- Medium-term (90-365 days): EWMA with λ=0.97 on 180 days (balanced approach)
- Long-term (>365 days): Historical volatility on 500 days (full market cycles)

This approach matches forecast horizon to lookback period, following academic
best practices from volatility forecasting literature.

\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Prefer this (implied + historical):
  vol <- get_volatility("AAPL", days_to_expiry = 30)

  # Or historical only:
  vol_historical <- calculate_adaptive_volatility("AAPL", days_to_expiry = 30)
}
