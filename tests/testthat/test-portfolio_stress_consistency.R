#' Regression Tests for Portfolio Stress Test Consistency
#'
#' These tests ensure that portfolio-level and position-level stress tests
#' calculate P&L consistently (both from purchase_price/cost basis).
#'
#' Bug fixed: Portfolio stress tests were using current_price as baseline,
#' while position stress tests used entry_price, causing confusion.
