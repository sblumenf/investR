**Current Grade: A- → Target Grade: A+**

**Phase 1 (Foundation): ✅ 100% COMPLETE**
**Phase 2 (Core Enhancements): ✅ 75% COMPLETE** (implemented but not integrated)
**Phase 3 (Integration): ⏳ 0% COMPLETE** (next major milestone)
**Phase 4-6 (Advanced): ⏳ 0% COMPLETE** (future work)

---

## What's Been Completed

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes & Infrastructure ✅

#### 1. Portfolio Stress Test Bug Fix ✅
**File:** `R/fct_portfolio_risk.R` (lines 748-759)

**Problem Fixed:** Portfolio-level and position-level stress tests were calculating P&L from different baselines:
- Position-level used `entry_price` (cost basis) → shows total profit/loss
- Portfolio-level used `current_price` → shows only incremental change

**Solution:** Both now use `purchase_price` (cost basis) for consistency.

**Impact:** This was causing $10,000+ differences in perceived risk for positions with significant unrealized gains. Now fixed.

**Test Coverage:** `tests/testthat/test-portfolio_stress_consistency.R`

---

#### 2. Tiered Configuration System ✅
**Files:**
- `R/utils_risk_presets.R` (new)
- `R/utils_risk_config.R` (enhanced)

**What It Does:**
Implements three-tier configuration following KISS principle:

**Tier 1: Presets** (for 90% of users)
```r
# Retail: Fast analysis (5-10 seconds)
config <- apply_risk_preset("retail")

# Professional: Balanced (10-20 seconds)
config <- apply_risk_preset("professional")  # DEFAULT

# Institutional: Maximum accuracy (20-40 seconds)
config <- apply_risk_preset("institutional")
```

**Tier 2: Feature Toggles**
```r
features = list(
  use_lsm = TRUE,                 # True LSM vs simple approximation
  use_implied_volatility = TRUE,  # Market vol vs historical only
  use_regime_adjustment = TRUE,   # Dynamic parameters
  use_correlated_jumps = TRUE     # Portfolio jump correlation
)
```

**Tier 3: Advanced Overrides**
```r
# Power users can override specific parameters
config <- apply_risk_preset("professional",
                           overrides = list(lsm_polynomial_degree = 4))
```

**Impact:** Simplifies configuration, enables easy comparison of analysis modes, provides path from simple to sophisticated.

---

#### 3. Shared Risk Engine Infrastructure ✅
**File:** `R/fct_shared_risk_engine.R` (new)

**What It Does:**
DRY principle - consolidates ALL simulation logic into a single reusable engine.

**Key Functions:**
```r
# Master simulation function (works for 1 or N positions)
simulate_correlated_paths(model_specs, correlation_matrix, n_paths)

# Model specification builder
create_model_spec(type = "jump_diffusion", S0 = 100, T = 0.25, sigma = 0.30)

# Supports three models:
# - "gbm": Simple geometric Brownian motion
# - "jump_diffusion": Merton (1976) with Poisson jumps
# - "heston": Heston (1993) stochastic volatility
```

**Impact:**
- Eliminates code duplication between position and portfolio analysis
- Makes it trivial to upgrade portfolio simulations to sophisticated models
- Single point of maintenance for all simulation logic

**Status:** Ready to use, but existing code still uses old simulation functions. Needs integration (Phase 3).

---

#### 4. PerformanceAnalytics Integration ✅
**File:** `R/fct_portfolio_risk.R` (lines 100-105)

**Problem Fixed:** Code imported PerformanceAnalytics but then manually calculated VaR/CVaR with `quantile()`.

**Solution:** Now actually uses `PerformanceAnalytics::VaR()` and `PerformanceAnalytics::ES()`.

**Impact:** Industry-standard calculations, validation of manual methods, consistency with academic literature.

---

### Phase 2: Core Enhancements ✅ (Implemented but Not Integrated)

#### 1. Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) Engine ✅
**File:** `R/fct_lsm_engine.R` (new, 400+ lines)

**What It Is:**
TRUE implementation of Longstaff-Schwartz (2001) method for American option early exercise. This is NOT the simple "dividend > time value" approximation that was there before.

**How It Works:**
1. Simulates price paths forward to expiration
2. Works backward from expiration using **regression**
3. At each dividend date:
   - Finds all in-the-money paths
   - Runs least squares regression: `continuation_value ~ polynomial(stock_price)`
   - Compares immediate exercise value vs. predicted continuation value
   - Chooses optimal action (exercise if immediate > continuation)
4. Learns optimal exercise boundary from the simulation itself

**Key Features:**
- Uses orthogonal polynomials (numerically stable)
- Configurable polynomial degree (default 3, can go 2-5)
- Minimum path threshold (skips regression if < 10 ITM paths)
- Handles multiple dividend dates with backward induction
- Includes comparison function to validate vs. simple method

**Main Function:**
```r
run_lsm_early_exercise(
  price_paths,           # From simulation
  strike,
  dividend_schedule,
  risk_free_rate,
  days_to_expiry
)

# Returns:
# - exercise_matrix: Boolean matrix (dividends × paths)
# - early_exercise_prob: Overall probability
# - exercise_by_dividend: Count per dividend date
```

**Academic Foundation:** Implements actual Longstaff-Schwartz (2001) algorithm, not an approximation.

**Test Coverage:** `tests/testthat/test-fct_lsm_engine.R` (7 tests covering edge cases)

**Status:** ✅ Implemented and tested, ⏳ NOT integrated into risk analysis functions yet.

---

#### 2. Implied Volatility Module ✅
**File:** `R/fct_implied_volatility.R` (new, 350+ lines)

**What It Does:**
Fetches options market data and calculates implied volatility using Black-Scholes inverse solver. Provides market-based volatility that complements historical estimates.

**Data Flow:**
1. Try Questrade API for options chain (stub - TODO)
2. Fallback to Yahoo Finance via quantmod (✅ implemented)
3. Filter to ATM options (within 10% of current price)
4. Calculate implied vol using Newton-Raphson iteration
5. Return median of ATM options (robust to outliers)
6. Blend with historical vol if both available

**Key Functions:**
```r
# DRY - Single volatility function for EVERYTHING
get_volatility(ticker, days_to_expiry,
              use_implied = TRUE,
              fallback_to_historical = TRUE,
              blend_weight = 0.70)

# Diagnostic tool
compare_implied_vs_historical("AAPL", 30)
```

**Solver Details:**
- Uses Brenner-Subrahmanyam approximation for initial guess
- Newton-Raphson iteration (max 20 iterations)
- Convergence threshold: 0.01 price difference
- Handles edge cases (zero time, zero price, non-convergence)

**Impact:**
- Market knows more than historical data (especially before events)
- Example: Before earnings, implied vol spikes to 45% while historical is 25%
- Using historical would systematically underestimate risk

**Status:** ✅ Implemented, ⏳ NOT integrated - existing code still uses `calculate_adaptive_volatility()` directly.

---

#### 3. Regime Detection Module ✅
**File:** `R/fct_regime_detection.R` (new, 300+ lines)

**What It Does:**
KISS principle - rule-based regime detection, NO machine learning. Uses simple threshold logic on market indicators.

**Regime Types:**
1. **Crisis**: VIX > 25 AND correlation > 0.70 → 2x jump frequency, 1.3x correlation
2. **Stressed**: VIX > 25 OR VIX rising 30%+ → 1.4x jump frequency, 1.15x correlation
3. **Correlation Spike**: High correlation even if VIX normal → Focus on correlation adjustment
4. **Calm**: VIX < 15 → 0.7x jump frequency (jumps less likely)
5. **Normal**: Default baseline parameters

**Market Indicators:**
- VIX (current, 20-day average, trend)
- Market correlation (from SPY/QQQ/IWM basket)
- Thresholds configurable in `RISK_CONFIG$advanced`

**Key Functions:**
```r
# Detect regime and get adjusted parameters
params <- get_regime_adjusted_parameters()

# Returns:
# - jump_frequency: Adjusted for regime
# - correlation_multiplier: For portfolio correlation
# - regime_name, description, risk_multiplier
# - Raw indicators (VIX, correlation)

# Display current regime
show_current_regime()
```

**Caching:** Results cached for 1 hour (market data doesn't change that fast).

**Impact:**
- Dynamically increases risk sensitivity in crisis vs. calm markets
- Example: March 2020 (VIX = 80) → crisis regime → 2x jump frequency
- Example: December 2019 (VIX = 12) → calm regime → 0.7x jump frequency

**Status:** ✅ Implemented with caching, ⏳ NOT integrated - parameters are not yet regime-adjusted.

## What's NOT Yet Integrated (Phase 3 Work)

### Critical Integration Tasks

#### 1. Integrate LSM into Risk Analysis
**Files to Modify:**
- `R/fct_monte_carlo.R` - Add LSM path in `run_monte_carlo_simulation()`
- `R/fct_risk_analysis.R` - Use LSM results in `analyze_position_risk()`
- `R/fct_portfolio_risk.R` - Apply LSM at portfolio level

**What to Do:**
```r
# In run_monte_carlo_simulation():
if (config$features$use_lsm && nrow(div_schedule) > 0) {
  # Use new LSM engine
  lsm_result <- run_lsm_early_exercise(...)
  # Use lsm_result$exercise_matrix to determine payoffs
} else {
  # Use simple approximation (existing code)
}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

---

#### 2. Integrate Implied Volatility Everywhere
**Files to Modify:**
- `R/fct_monte_carlo.R` - Replace volatility calculations
- `R/fct_portfolio_risk.R` - Use get_volatility() in simulations
- `R/fct_early_exercise.R` - Use market vol for Greeks
- `R/utils_risk_helpers.R` - Deprecate old calculate_adaptive_volatility() or make it internal

**What to Do:**
Replace all instances of:
```r
sigma <- calculate_adaptive_volatility(ticker, days_to_expiry)
```

With:
```r
sigma <- get_volatility(ticker, days_to_expiry,
                       use_implied = config$features$use_implied_volatility)
```

**Search Pattern:** `Grep "calculate_adaptive_volatility" -i` to find all usages

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

---

#### 3. Integrate Regime Adjustments
**Files to Modify:**
- `R/fct_monte_carlo.R` - Use regime-adjusted jump parameters
- `R/fct_portfolio_risk.R` - Use regime-adjusted correlation

**What to Do:**
```r
# At start of simulations:
if (config$features$use_regime_adjustment) {
  regime_params <- get_regime_adjusted_parameters()

  # Use regime_params$jump_frequency instead of RISK_CONFIG$jump_frequency
  # Multiply correlation matrix by regime_params$correlation_multiplier
}
```

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

---

#### 4. Use Shared Risk Engine
**Files to Modify:**
- `R/fct_monte_carlo.R` - Refactor to use `simulate_correlated_paths()`
- `R/fct_portfolio_risk.R` - Replace custom simulation with shared engine

**What to Do:**
Instead of custom simulation loops, build model specs and call:
```r
model_specs <- list(
  create_model_spec("jump_diffusion", S0 = current_price, T = T_years, sigma = sigma)
)

paths <- simulate_correlated_paths(model_specs, n_paths = n_paths)
```

**Benefit:** DRY - one simulation implementation, easy to upgrade to Heston at portfolio level

**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours (requires careful refactoring)

---

#### 5. Update UI to Show New Metrics
**Files to Modify:**
- `R/mod_position_risk.R` - Add LSM details, regime info, implied vol source

**What to Add:**
- Summary tab: Show "Implied Vol: 32% (market), Historical: 28%"
- Summary tab: Show "Market Regime: Stressed (VIX=27)"
- New "LSM Details" section: Show exercise probabilities by dividend
- Distribution tab: Color code paths by exercise/hold decision

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

---

## Remaining Features (Phase 4-6)

### Phase 4: Validation (Not Started)

#### Calibration Documentation
- Document where jump parameters came from (S&P 500 analysis)
- Show backtesting results on historical data
- Sensitivity analysis (vary parameters, show impact)

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks

#### Backtesting Framework
- Run model on historical covered call positions
- Compare predicted prob of profit vs. actual outcomes
- Validate: "When model said 75% prob, did it happen 75% of time?"

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks

---

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Not Started)

#### Portfolio Greeks Aggregation
- Sum individual position Greeks to portfolio level
- Show: "Portfolio is short 250 delta, short 1200 vega"
- Attribution: Which positions contribute most to portfolio Greeks?

**Estimated Effort:** 1 week

#### Dynamic Rebalancing Suggestions
- Detect concentration risks
- Simulate: "If you close NVDA and open COST, VaR improves from -$4200 to -$3100"
- Show efficient frontier (risk vs return tradeoff)

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks

---

### Phase 6: Polish (Not Started)

#### Performance Optimization
- Profile code, identify bottlenecks
- Parallel processing for portfolio simulations (if needed)
- Optimize LSM regression (vectorize where possible)

**Estimated Effort:** 1 week

#### Documentation
- User guide for presets
- Examples and use cases
- API documentation for power users

**Estimated Effort:** 1 week

---

## How to Continue Implementation

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 3)

**Step 1: Test Current Implementation**
Run the app, try risk analysis, verify Phase 1 fixes work:
```r
# Should now use PerformanceAnalytics
analyze_portfolio_risk(simulation_paths = 10000)

# Should show consistent P&L
# (position stress test vs portfolio stress test)
```

**Step 2: Integrate LSM** (Highest Impact)
- Modify `R/fct_monte_carlo.R` to call `run_lsm_early_exercise()`
- Add config check: `if (config$features$use_lsm)`
- Test on high-dividend stock (PG, JNJ, O)
- Compare LSM prob vs simple prob using `compare_lsm_vs_simple()`
- Expected: LSM should be 5-15% more accurate

**Step 3: Integrate Implied Volatility** (High Impact)
- Create wrapper in `utils_risk_helpers.R` that routes to `get_volatility()`
- Update all call sites
- Test on volatile stock before earnings
- Expected: Implied vol should spike before events

**Step 4: Integrate Regime Detection** (Moderate Impact)
- Add regime check at start of simulations
- Use adjusted parameters
- Test during high VIX period
- Expected: Crisis regime should increase VaR estimates

**Step 5: Refactor to Shared Engine** (Moderate Effort, High Long-term Value)
- Start with portfolio simulations (easier)
- Then refactor position simulations
- Verify results match before/after
- Enable sophisticated models at portfolio level

**Step 6: Update UI** (Medium Priority)
- Add regime indicator
- Show LSM details
- Display implied vs historical vol

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Add As You Integrate)
- LSM integration: Test that exercise decisions affect payoffs correctly
- Implied vol: Test that market vol is used when available
- Regime: Test that parameters adjust based on VIX

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end position analysis with LSM enabled
- Portfolio analysis with regime adjustment
- Verify results are reasonable (not 10x different from before)

### Regression Tests
- Keep existing tests passing
- Ensure backward compatibility where needed
- Test that presets produce expected behavior

---

## Configuration Management

### Preset Definitions
Located in `R/utils_risk_presets.R`:
- `retail`: Fast, simple (5-10s)
- `professional`: Balanced, default (10-20s)
- `institutional`: Accurate, slow (20-40s)

### Toggling Features
In `RISK_CONFIG$features`:
```r
use_lsm = TRUE                  # Enable LSM
use_implied_volatility = TRUE   # Enable implied vol
use_regime_adjustment = TRUE    # Enable regime detection
use_correlated_jumps = TRUE     # Enable jump correlation (portfolio)
```

### Advanced Overrides
In `RISK_CONFIG$advanced`:
```r
lsm_polynomial_degree = 3           # LSM regression degree
regime_vix_thresholds = c(15, 25)  # Regime detection thresholds
implied_vol_blend_weight = 0.70    # How much to weight implied vs historical
```

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation
1. **Questrade implied vol stub** - Not implemented yet, uses Yahoo only
2. **No parallel processing** - Future optimization
3. **Regime detection caching** - 1 hour cache might miss rapid market changes
4. **Portfolio Heston** - Shared engine supports it but not enabled yet

### By Design
1. **No ML** - Per your request, using simple rules only
2. **Daily price data** - Intraday volatility not captured
3. **Historical correlation** - Assumes past correlations persist

---

## Conclusion

**Current State:** Foundation is solid (A-). Core enhancements are built but not integrated.

**Next Milestone:** Complete Phase 3 integration → Achieve A grade

**Final Milestone:** Complete validation and advanced features → Achieve A+

**Time Estimate:**
- Phase 3 (Integration): 20-30 hours
- Phase 4 (Validation): 40-60 hours
- Phase 5 (Advanced): 60-80 hours
- Phase 6 (Polish): 20-30 hours

**Total: 140-200 hours** (17-25 working days at 8hr/day)

The hard mathematical work is done. What remains is integration, validation, and polish.
