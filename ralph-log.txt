## Summary

Completed 2 of 9 batches in this Ralph iteration:

**Batch 1: Cash-Secured Puts (11 files)**
- 4 Critical findings: NA propagation in calculations, unvalidated option data structures
- 7 High findings: Silent API failures, no Questrade fallback notifications, reactive side effects  
- 8 Medium findings: Hardcoded config values, code duplication, missing rate limiting
- 3 Low findings: Verbose logging, code style issues

**Batch 2: Covered Calls / Dynamic Covered Calls (9 files)**
- 3 Critical findings: Unvalidated drawdown metrics, config validation gaps, cache TTL enforcement missing
- 5 High findings: Error swallowing in async execution, missing fallback notifications, zero-dividend filter logic error
- 6 Medium findings: Hardcoded values breaking config chain, inconsistent error handling patterns
- 2 Low findings: Verbose logging

Both audit documents saved to `docs/audit/` with detailed file:line references for each finding. Progress tracked in `ralph-progress.md`. 

Next iteration should continue with Batch 3 (Dividend Capture - 20 files) per the spec workflow.
