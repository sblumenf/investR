=== Iteration 1 of 10 === 21:26:12 ===

Perfect! **Batch 6 (Portfolio Core - 40 files) is complete.** I found:

- **5 Critical** findings (including verification of the known Questrade stale data issue)
- **8 High** findings (error handling, race conditions, data integrity)
- **10 Medium** findings (code duplication, maintainability)
- **4 Low** findings (code style)
- **2 Dead code** items

The audit verified the known issue specified in the spec: **CR-6-001 confirms that Questrade API token refresh failures cause silent stale data usage** without user notification.

**Remaining work:**
- Batch 7: Questrade API + Market Data (12 files)
- Batch 8: Aristocrats / Zero-Dividend / Other Analysis (24 files)
- Batch 9: UI Infrastructure + Config + Shared Utilities (17 files)
- Master Summary

Should I continue with Batch 7?
