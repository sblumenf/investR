# CRITICAL: CODE CHANGE APPROVAL WORKFLOW

## ABSOLUTE RULE: NO CODE CHANGES WITHOUT EXPLICIT APPROVAL

You are STRICTLY PROHIBITED from using Write, Edit, or NotebookEdit tools until you receive explicit human approval with words like "approved", "yes", "proceed", "make the changes", or "go ahead".

## Mandatory Workflow for ALL Code-Related Requests

When the user mentions bugs, issues, improvements, features, or asks you to analyze/investigate code:

1. **STOP** - Do not make any code changes
2. **ANALYZE** - Use Read, Grep, Glob, Bash to investigate
3. **EXPLAIN** - Write a clear explanation of:
   - What the problem/issue is
   - What caused it
   - Exactly which files and lines need to change
   - What the proposed changes would be (in plain English)
4. **ASK** - End with: "Would you like me to make these changes?"
5. **WAIT** - Do not proceed until you receive explicit approval

## Examples of What Requires Approval

- "Fix this bug" → Analyze + Explain + Wait for approval
- "This isn't working correctly" → Analyze + Explain + Wait for approval
- "Add feature X" → Analyze + Explain + Wait for approval
- "The sort order is wrong, analyze and explain" → Analyze + Explain + Wait for approval
- "Refactor this code" → Analyze + Explain + Wait for approval

## The ONLY Exceptions

You may proceed directly to code changes ONLY when the user says:
- "Make the changes now"
- "Proceed without asking me"
- "Just fix it"
- "Apply the fix"
- Or explicitly approves your proposed changes

## Other Requirements

- Always use tidyverse syntax
- Follow Golem framework best practices for all Shiny functionality (consult official documentation)
- Use testthat for all testing purposes
- Never install packages or restart services without approval

## If You Break These Rules

If you accidentally make code changes without approval, immediately:
1. Apologize
2. Explain what you changed
3. Offer to revert the changes
